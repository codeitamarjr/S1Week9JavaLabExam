# Week9JavaLabExam

This is the first Lab EXAM of my BSc. in Computing


A town runs a lottery for its residence. You have been asked to write a simple lottery program for them to calculate the winnings. Here is how the lottery system works:
A winning tickets consists of 3 different numbers between 1 and 24, and they are secretly selected. Then the lottery program will ask a player to input 3 different numbers between 1 and 24. (NOTE, it is important that each numbers in the winning numbers or playerâ€™s numbers are unique). The winnings are calculated based on the following:

Conditions	Results
All 3 numbers have matched	Tell the player that she/he has won the first prize.
2 numbers have matched	Tell the player that she/he has won the second prize.
Only 1 number has matched	Tell the player that she/he has won the third prize.
None of numbers has matched	Tell the player good luck next time.


This is how your program should work:

(i) Create winning ticket numbers
You program will assign randomly 3 unique numbers between 1 and 24 as the winning numbers.

(ii) Input customer name, and 3 numbers between 1 and 24.
Ask a customer to input her/his full name, and 3 unique numbers between 1 and 24.

(iii) Calculate the winnings.
After the data is entered, the program calculate the winnings and print out the result on the screen.

Example:

Input

Please enter your name: John Murphy
Enter the first number for your lottery ticket: 23
Enter the second number for your lottery ticket: 5
Enter the third number for your lottery ticket: 6



                                                   Output

Dear John Murphy.
Your lotter ticket number is: 24, 5, 6
Congratulations! You have won the first prize!



(a) Using either a flowchart or pseudo-code, construct an algorithm for the problem.
(b) Create two sets of test data  in order to test your program.
(c) Implement the algorithm in (a) above in Java.
